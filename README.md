# ⚙️ PowerShell Scripts

Welcome to my collection of PowerShell scripts — written, tested, and used in real-world scenarios.  
This repository is part of my journey to better understand automation, system management, and the joys (and pitfalls) of scripting.

## 🧰 What to Expect

This repo is a mixed toolbox of PowerShell scripts that I've created over time — either to solve a specific problem, learn something new, or just make daily tasks less repetitive.

You’ll find scripts for things like:

- 🔍 Investigating user or machine activity  
- 🧼 Cleaning up old or unused AD objects  
- 🧮 Comparing configurations or group memberships  
- 🌐 Checking network or subnet status  

Each script lives in its own folder and may include a README or example usage.

## 🎯 Goals

- Learning by doing   
- Automate where it makes sense   
- Keep scripts clear, reusable, and practical 

## 📁 Folder Structure

Every folder in this repo represents a standalone script or a small module.  
Naming is kept short and descriptive — no fluff, just function.

## 📌 Notes

- This is a personal project and a work in progress.  
- Not everything is polished or production-ready — but everything here has a purpose.  
- Feedback, suggestions, or improvements are always welcome!
